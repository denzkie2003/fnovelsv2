However, due to global disasters caused by the reckless behavior of Wanderers in the past, the Executioner must kill them as soon as they’re found.\n\nOne day, the Executioner, Menou, meets a lost girl, Akari. Menou carries out her mission calmly and without hesitation. However, for some reason, Akari, whom she surely killed, resurrects without a care in the world. At a loss, Menou tricks the immortal Akari into coming along on a journey to find a way to kill her, but…\n\n“Menou. Let’s go!”\n\n”Yes yes yes. I understand.”\n\nMenou‘s mind begins to waver a little as she faces the strangely relaxed Akari.\n\n— this is the story of how she’s going to kill her.",
